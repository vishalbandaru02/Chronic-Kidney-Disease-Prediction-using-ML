# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction-using-ML
This project focuses on predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using Machine Learning techniques based on clinical and laboratory parameters. The model analyzes patient data such as age, blood pressure, hemoglobin levels, serum creatinine, and other medical attributes to classify whether a patient is at risk of CKD.
